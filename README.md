# 📃 TO-DO List Application  

Managing tasks can sometimes feel overwhelming, but having a simple and efficient to-do list can bring clarity to your day. This project is a small yet powerful step toward organizing daily tasks seamlessly. 🚀

## 🤠 Technologies I Learned & Used  

While building this to-do list, I not only applied my existing knowledge but also **learned new technologies** that made development smoother and more efficient.  

- **HTML** - Structured the webpage with semantic elements for accessibility and clarity.  
- **CSS & SCSS** - Styled the UI beautifully, and **SCSS** helped in writing cleaner, modular, and maintainable styles.  
- **JavaScript** - Brought the application to life by handling:  
  - Creating and removing elements dynamically.  
  - Using event listeners for user interactions.  
  - Implementing **local storage** to save tasks even after refreshing the page.  
- **npm (Node Package Manager)** - This project introduced me to npm, which helped in managing dependencies efficiently and automating tasks.  

This project wasn’t just about coding—it was about **learning and growing as a developer.** 🌱

## 💡 Reflections  

Throughout this journey, I have learned a great deal from **Dave Gray**, whose tutorials made complex concepts feel simple and approachable. His teaching style is incredible, and I’m truly grateful for the knowledge he shares with the developer community. 🙌  

This is just the beginning! More features and improvements to come. 😊💙
